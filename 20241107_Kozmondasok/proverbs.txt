 Actions speak louder than words. 
 The early bird catches the worm. 
 Don't count your chickens before they hatch. 
 Every cloud has a silver lining. 
 A picture is worth a thousand words. 
 When in Rome, do as the Romans do. 
 Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 
 Two wrongs don't make a right. 
 Where there's smoke, there's fire. 
 Don't bite the hand that feeds you. 
 You can't have your cake and eat it too. 
 The grass is always greener on the other side. 
 All that glitters is not gold. 
 The pen is mightier than the sword. 
 People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. 
 Don't cry over spilled milk. 
 Actions speak louder than words. 
 The more, the merrier. 
 A watched pot never boils. 
 The devil is in the details. 
 Don't judge a book by its cover. 
 Rome wasn't built in a day. 
 All good things must come to an end. 
 When the going gets tough, the tough get going. 
 Two heads are better than one. 
 Birds of a feather flock together. 
 Better late than never. 
 Curiosity killed the cat. 
 You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. 
 Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
